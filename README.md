How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I ensure my code is secure by carefully checking the privacy of classes, objects and attributes where necessary. I also look for proper input validation as well as user authentication/authorization.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

The best way to do this is by asking users of similar programs or people who have an interest for whatever the program will be created. 

How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software by making sure I have as good of an understanding of what is expected of me as I can before I even start coding. Otherwise, the project can go downhill very quickly and end with too many errors to fix in a reasonable time.
